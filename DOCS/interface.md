and modularity of code. Main features :- 

1. Decoupling and Flexibility
2. Polymorphism
3. Mocking and Testing
4. Type Abstraction
5. Resusability
6. Design Pattern Support (Strategy , Factory , Adapter)
7. Implicit implementation
8. Zero-Value Interfaces or empty interfaces - 
empty interface ((interface{}) in Go can be used to represent any type. It is useful in the scenarios
