Memory Efficiency-->:
Since an empty struct takes up no memory, it's useful when you want to represent something that doesn't carry any data but is used for signaling or controlling flow in a program (e.g., in channels or maps).

Set-Like Structures-->:
Go does not have a built-in set data structure, but you can emulate a set by using a map with an empty struct as the value type. The keys in the map will represent the elements of the set, and the empty struct as the value consumes no additional memory.

Channel Synchronization-->:
You can use empty structs to signal between goroutines because sending an empty struct over a channel doesn't carry any data, but it effectively acts as a signal (with zero memory overhead).
